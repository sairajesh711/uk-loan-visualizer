UK Loan Overpayment & Investment Visualizer
This project is a design-first, client-side application built to provide a clear, intuitive, and powerful answer to a common financial question for UK consumers with existing loans: "What is the smartest way to use my extra money to pay off my loan early?"

It intentionally avoids complex backend logic to focus on creating an exceptional user experience that empowers users to make informed financial decisions through data visualization and interaction design.

The Product Vision
While banks provide initial loan details, they rarely offer tools that help borrowers compare repayment strategies against other financial opportunities. This tool fills that gap.

The User Pain Point: Borrowers often hear that overpaying is a good idea, but the benefits feel abstract. Furthermore, they are left wondering: "Am I better off clearing my debt faster, or could my money be working harder for me if I invested it instead?"

Our Solution: A highly interactive, single-page application that provides instant visual feedback on three key financial scenarios: standard repayment, monthly overpayments, and investing the equivalent amount. By manipulating simple controls, users can immediately see:

Time Saved: An interactive chart dynamically shortens, showing how many years are cut from the loan term.

Interest Saved vs. Potential Gains: A clear comparison between the interest payments avoided by overpaying versus the potential returns from investing the same money.

Net Financial Position: A final, powerful summary showing which strategy leads to a better financial outcome over the original term of the loan.

Key Features & Design Philosophy
Minimalist UI: A clean, single-view interface that focuses the user's attention on the comparison between different financial strategies.

Trio of Interactive Tools:

Overpayment Slider: A simple, satisfying slider for setting a recurring monthly overpayment amount.

Early Settlement Calculator: An input field to model the impact of a one-off lump sum payment.

Opportunity Cost Visualizer: A powerful simulator that answers the question: "Should I overpay or invest?" It provides a side-by-side comparison of the financial outcome of overpaying the loan versus investing the same amount in a savings account (e.g., at 4.5% interest) or the stock market (e.g., at an average 7% return).

Real-time Charting: Using a library like Chart.js or D3.js to provide smooth, animated transitions as the data changes.

Mobile-First: Designed to be perfectly usable and beautiful on a mobile device.

No Data Storage: Purely a client-side calculator. User data is never stored, ensuring privacy and simplicity.
